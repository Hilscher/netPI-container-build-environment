## Docker Development Environment (deprecated)

This repo is deprecated and no longer maintained. Running Docker in Docker as it was implemented in this container does not work properly on netPI cause of its security restrictions. So netPI is and remains a Docker host only and developments of container images can only executed on system with unrestricted access to the Docker Deamon like standard Raspberry Pi running Raspbian.
